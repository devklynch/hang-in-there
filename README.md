This allows a user to view, save, and create motivational posters as well as view and delete unmotivational posters.
### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
They would need to clone the repo and from the folder open the index.html

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I'm currently on week 2 of Mod2. This project was assigned on day 1 of Mod2 and I had about a week and a half to complete it. I had little to no experience with Javascript prior to this. And learned 

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
-Practice reading, understanding, and using existing code
-Write clean, DRY JavaScript
    -Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
    -Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
    -Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM
-Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
This really helped me get used to Javascript and event listeners and get a better understanding on how Javascript, CSS, and HTML are linked.

My wins are tied to the challenges I faced. I struggled a lot of with the logic needed to remove an unmotivational poster from the array as well as with making sure the poster was deleted if you clicked anywhere on the poster.
